# Progress log

Newest first. One entry per session: what broke, the cause, the fix, with evidence.

## 2026-10-28: kickoff

- Route chosen: dream-recomp (GPL-2.0, ARM64 parity by design, Vulkan renderer). SARecomp could
  not be a base: its repo holds only the Sonic adapter; the KatanaRecomp SDK and generated code it
  links are private (`CMakeLists.txt` refuses to configure without `.local/baseline/r354`), and
  the KatanaRecomp repo now returns 404. SARecomp's own notes say development was discontinued.
- Disc: PAL v1.003 GDI, all three tracks match SARecomp's published SHA-256s; IP.BIN reads
  "SONIC ADVENTURE, MK-5100050 V1.003 (19990909)", CRC ok, not Windows CE.
- Extracted 2699 files (993 MB) with `tools/extract_resumable.py` (dcdisc in passes; one
  `new-game` run cannot finish inside the bridge's 3-minute call limit). Config written by
  `dcdisc new-game` with defaults; no seeds yet.
- Code files found by `dcdisc scan`: 1ST_READ.BIN (6.7 MB), 2_DP.BIN (2.8 MB, SH-4, needs a
  relocation entry), MAIGO.BIN and SG_DPLDR.BIN (14.8 KB each).
- dream-recomp pinned at 51a148c (2026-09-21).
